# Prototype Mobile & Api

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

* [Expo](https://expo.io/) & [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
* [npx](https://github.com/zkat/npx)

* Install the expo cli, nodejs, and npx (Once you have nodejs installed run `npm i -g npx`)

**Note** you should either have a ios/android simulator or the expo app on your real device.
If using the simulator use the expo cli to boot the simulator, this only has to be done once to install the expo app on the simulator.
`exp ios start` / `exp android start` is the command, for android you may have to do a few more steps pertaining to the simulator.
Once you've done that proceed to the `mobile/` dir for further instructions.

## Installing

* See `mobile/` && `api/` directories respectively to see how to install
